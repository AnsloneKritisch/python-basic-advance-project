#but we need to store the data somewhere right ???
name = input("What is your name ?")
print("Hello " + name)

#what about data we need to store 

name = " Anslone Kritisch"
print("Hello " + name)

#this is called variable

#Just imagine if you need to calculate the length of the data

name = " Anslone Kritisch "
print( len(name) )

#let's take input and find out the length of the data

name = input("What is your name ?")
print( len(name) )

#let's do it in one line 

print(len(input("What is your name")))

#here you get it - now your variables are variabling
