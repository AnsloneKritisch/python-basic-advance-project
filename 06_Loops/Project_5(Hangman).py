# todo 1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word. Then print it to the console to check that you've chosen the word correctly. Hint: Remember to import the random module first. ðŸŽ²

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
# print(chosen_word , "is the chosen word")

#todo 4 - Create an empty List called display. For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'. So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"]. Hint: Remember that a List is a collection of items.

word_length = len(chosen_word)

display = ["_"] * word_length 

print(display)

# todo 2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

# todo 3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. If it is, print "Right" on the console, otherwise print "Wrong".

# for letter in chosen_word:
    # print(letter)
    # if letter == guess:
    #     print("Right")
    # else:
    #     print("Wrong")


# todo 5 - Loop through each position in the chosen_word; if the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position. For example, if the user guessed "p" and the chosen_word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"]. Hint: You'll need to loop through the string and find the index of each letter, so using a for loop combined with range() will be helpful. e.g. for position in range(word_length).

# for i in range(word_length):
#     letter = chosen_word[i]
#     if letter == guess:
#         display[i] = letter

# print(display)



# todo 6 - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more "_" characters. Then you can tell the user they've won.

# while "_" in display:
#     guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

#     for i in range(word_length):
#         letter = chosen_word[i]
#         if letter == guess:
#             display[i] = letter

#     print(display)

# todo 7 - create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives the user has. Set 'lives' to equal 6.

lifes = 6

# todo 8 - create stages of hangman as a list of strings.
