# still wondering about if , else and <= operator

# lemme solve your problem 

# these are called the conditional opertors 

# which ??????????????????? 
# why talking like my ex ?????? 

# COOOOOOOLLLLL DOWN GUYS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<= # less than equal to
>= # greater than equal to
> # greater than 
> # less than

== # comparison operator compare two data is equal or not equal to each other

a == b # is a equal to b ??? 

# if a is equal to b then it will print "yes" otherwise it will print "no"

if a == b:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
    
# what is i need to check they are not equal

# a != b this not equal comparison operator


a = 10
b = 11

if a!= b:
    print("yes")
    
# now let's talk about modulas 

    # modulas is a special operator that gives the remainder of a division
    
    # for example 10 % 3 = 1
    
    # it means 10 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1
    
    # modulas is useful when you want to find the remainder of a division
    
    # it is also used to check if a number is even or odd
    
    # if a number is divisible by 2 then it is even otherwise it is odd
    
    # let's see the example with modulas
    
    number = 10
    
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is odd")
