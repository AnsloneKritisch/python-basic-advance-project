# Why does not the water bath tub flow ??

# because there is a condition which prevents it and that is
# if height is greater than = 80 cm  it will flow and sink out 
# else let the water fill the tub right ??

# can we code that out ?? 

    # let's create a program to simulate this

height = float(input("Enter the height of the water : "))

if height >= 80:
    print("The water will flow out through the sink to prevent overflow")
    print("Please turn off the tap , Save water")
    
else:    
    print("The water will fill the tub")
